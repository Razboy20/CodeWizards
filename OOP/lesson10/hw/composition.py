# Our table is composed of multiple items, like computer, coffee mug, pen holder, books.
# Use composition to implement this example
#
# - Create a separate class for Computer, Coffee Mug and Pen holder with it's attributes and methods.
#
# - Create a class Table and use Composition to link all the above things together.
# 
# - Run the methods of above classes using the Table object.
#
# But if you have any other example in your mind, you can implement that as well.
